finish the window deformation method
    add reference to Scarano and Riethmuller, Meunier
    try nearest neighbour
    try linear interpolation
    try smoothing
retain s2n output option
    debug it to ensure it works
make API consistent with CPU version
replace slow functions with CUDA kernels or CupY functions
    gradient
    window slicing
    use CuPy to do array computations
reactivate the extended search area
implement choosing advanced algorithm features
multiprocessing framework that works with the other windef function as well
Need to have easy-to-use functions available for non-expert
    consult the mother repository for this
change the README
