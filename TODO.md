# List of things to do
This list is in no particular order of importance

## Break down massive F array
In the WiDIM function, there is a massive array that holds all the variables for every iteration.

## Multithreading
Spin off multiple threads to utilize multiple GPUs

## Port to Python 3
I don't think this would be that hard. Change up some print statements, get rid of the progress bar
